\section{Domain Context}
Go into more information regarding information propagation in Twitter and about the mechanics of Twitter. Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item communities and how networks form
\item information quality
\item information relevance
\item information retrieval
\item information filtration
\item `search bubbles'
\item propagation
\item categorise above into subsections (possibilities: the network and communities, information retrieval and relevance, information retrieval and bubbles, and retweeting as a form of propagation)
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Motivation}
Link to `The Problem' in introduction chapter. Talk about wanting to allow people to be exposed to information that they are \textit{likely} to find interesting based on the interestingness of the tweet, but without them having to search for the information or follow the users responsible for sourcing or forwarding the information. \\ \\
Further work would be done on refining this based on a per-user basis (i.e. that user's particular interests as a relevance metric for the interestingness of the Tweet).
