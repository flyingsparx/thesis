	Abstract = {Social Web describes a new culture of participation on the
 Web where more and more people actively participate in
 publishing and organizing Web content. As part of this cul-
 ture, people leave a variety of traces when interacting with
 (other people via) Social Web systems. In this paper, we
 investigate user modeling strategies for inferring personal
 interest proles from Social Web interactions. In particular,
 we analyze individual micro-blogging activities on Twitter.
 We compare dierent strategies for creating user proles
 based on the Twitter messages a user has published and
 study how these proles change over time. Moreover, we
 evaluate the quality of the user modeling strategies in the
 context of personalized recommender systems and show that
 those strategies which consider the temporal dynamics of the
 individual proles allow for the best performance.},

@book{dawkins76,
	Abstract = {{Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson,  and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <I>The Selfish Gene</I>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.  <P> Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <I>memes</I>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. <i>--Rob Lightner</i> } {Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it.  His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.  <P>In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature.  Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.  <P>This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters.  One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world.  The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.}},

	Abstract = {We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in media consumption, the relationship between vari- ous classes of media, and the diversity of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is a non-negligible amount of indirect media expo- sure, either through friends who followparticular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a surprising ex- tent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can help predict howwe will read news, and howpublishers will interact with us in the future.},

	Abstract = {Application deployment on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is a challenging issue. First it requires communication abstractions that allow for interoperation with Internet applications and second the offered solution should be sensitive to the available resources in the underlying network. Loosely coupled communication abstractions, like publish/subscribe, promote interoperability, but unfortunately are typically implemented at the application layer without considering the available resources at the underlay imposing a significant degradation of application performance in the setting of Wireless Mesh Networks. In this paper we present SPINE, a content-based publish/subscribe system, {\^A}  which considers the particular challenges of deploying application-level services in Wireless Mesh Networks. SPINE is designed to reduce the overhead which stems from both publications and reconfigurations, to cope with the inherent capacity limitations on communication links as well as with mobility of the wireless mesh-clients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPINE by comparison with traditional approaches in implementing content-based publish/subscribe.},

	Abstract = {Once a problem associated only with email, spam is now affecting other media, such as instant messaging, blogs, newsgroups and mobile phone messaging. As wireless networks become more commonplace, we can expect that spam will find its way into upcoming wireless communication services. This paper studies the threat posed by malicious nodes inserting spam in a wireless network using gossiping as a method for information dissemination. We identify the security mechanisms needed to protect our gossip network against the proliferation of spam, reducing the problem to a matter of finding and removing corrupted messages. Finally, we propose a probabilistic method of integrity checking to contain the spread of spam which we evaluate through extensive simulations},

	Abstract = {The prospect of having an easily-deployable, selfconfiguring network for a relatively low investment has made wireless mesh networks an attractive platform to provide wireless services. With the significant attention currently placed on wireless mesh networking, deployment of these mesh networks may be imminent. However, even with the infrastructure in place, development of flexible middleware has yet to reach a level where it can deliver on the promise of mesh networks due to the special characteristics of wireless connectivity. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized news service based on epidemics. Its simple design makes for a scalable and robust solution, flexible enough to be used as the basis for other more sophisticated applications.},

	Abstract = {Traffic engineering, as its name, is the art of manipulating traffic around so that traffic from congested links is moved onto the unused capacity on the other links. So, providing traffic engineering support in multi-hop wireless network has become increasingly important due to the low bandwidth nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a novel approach to control the traffic to avoid congestion by decoupling forwarding process from the routing process. The proposal is interested in provisioning quality of service guarantees for planned Wireless Mesh Networks which are being used widely as a broadband wireless access network.},

	Abstract = {Sensor networks with a number of wirelessly inter-connected devices have proven useful for many applications in diverse domains. The challenges of scale and resource constraints posed by this system have led to development of novel network protocols and services, but their focus has been on traditional metrics of quality of service of network data transport. Arguing that a holistic view of these systems requires an end-to-end view that combines networking quality of service concerns with the data quality and integrity of sensor sources and performance of sensor fusion algorithms, we propose to use the ldquoquality of informationrdquo (QoI) as a performance metric associated with the end result produced by a sensor network. In this paper we describe the factors that affect QoI, and describe how network protocols and services can be designed to be QoI aware.},
