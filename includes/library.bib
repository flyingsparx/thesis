	Abstract = {A variety of different social, natural and technological systems can be described by the same mathematical framework. This holds from the Internet to food webs and to boards of company directors. In all these situations a graph of the elements of the system and their interconnections displays a universal feature. There are only few elements with many connections, and many elements with few connections. This book presents the experimental evidence of these \&quot;Scale-free networks\&quot; and provides students and researchers with a corpus of theoretical results and algorithms to analyse and understand these features. The content of this book and the exposition makes it a clear textbook for beginners, and a reference book for the experts.

@inproceedings{zadeh13,
	Abstract = {The diusion of information on online social and information
networks has been a popular topic of study in recent years,
but attention has typically focused on speed of dissemination and recall (i.e. the fraction of users getting a piece of
information). In this paper, we study the complementary
notion of the precision of information diusion. Our model
of information dissemination is \broadcast-based", i.e., one
where every message (original or forwarded) from a user goes
to a xed set of recipients, often called the user's \friends" or
\followers", as in Facebook and Twitter. The precision of the
diusion process is then dened as the fraction of received
messages that a user nds interesting.
On rst glance, it seems that broadcast-based information
diusion is a \blunt" targeting mechanism, and must necessarily suer from low precision. Somewhat surprisingly, we
present preliminary experimental and analytical evidence to
the contrary: it is possible to simultaneously have high precision (i.e. is bounded below by a constant), high recall, and
low diameter!
We start by presenting a set of conditions on the structure of user interests, and analytically show the necessity of
each of these conditions for obtaining high precision. We
also present preliminary experimental evidence from Twitter verifying that these conditions are satised. We then
prove that the Kronecker-graph based generative model of
Leskovec et al. satises these conditions given an appropriate and natural denition of user interests. Further, we
show that this model also has high precision, high recall, and
low diameter. We nally present preliminary experimental
evidence showing Twitter has high precision, validating our
conclusion. This is perhaps a rst step towards a formal
understanding of the immense popularity of online social
networks as an information dissemination mechanism.      },

	Abstract = {Social Web describes a new culture of participation on the
 Web where more and more people actively participate in
 publishing and organizing Web content. As part of this cul-
 ture, people leave a variety of traces when interacting with
 (other people via) Social Web systems. In this paper, we
 investigate user modeling strategies for inferring personal
 interest proles from Social Web interactions. In particular,
 we analyze individual micro-blogging activities on Twitter.
 We compare dierent strategies for creating user proles
 based on the Twitter messages a user has published and
 study how these proles change over time. Moreover, we
 evaluate the quality of the user modeling strategies in the
 context of personalized recommender systems and show that
 those strategies which consider the temporal dynamics of the
 individual proles allow for the best performance.},

@book{dawkins76,
	Abstract = {{Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson,  and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <I>The Selfish Gene</I>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.  <P> Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <I>memes</I>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. <i>--Rob Lightner</i> } {Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it.  His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.  <P>In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature.  Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.  <P>This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters.  One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world.  The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.}},

	Abstract = {We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in media consumption, the relationship between vari- ous classes of media, and the diversity of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is a non-negligible amount of indirect media expo- sure, either through friends who followparticular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a surprising ex- tent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can help predict howwe will read news, and howpublishers will interact with us in the future.},

	Abstract = {Application deployment on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is a challenging issue. First it requires communication abstractions that allow for interoperation with Internet applications and second the offered solution should be sensitive to the available resources in the underlying network. Loosely coupled communication abstractions, like publish/subscribe, promote interoperability, but unfortunately are typically implemented at the application layer without considering the available resources at the underlay imposing a significant degradation of application performance in the setting of Wireless Mesh Networks. In this paper we present SPINE, a content-based publish/subscribe system, {\^A}  which considers the particular challenges of deploying application-level services in Wireless Mesh Networks. SPINE is designed to reduce the overhead which stems from both publications and reconfigurations, to cope with the inherent capacity limitations on communication links as well as with mobility of the wireless mesh-clients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPINE by comparison with traditional approaches in implementing content-based publish/subscribe.},

As wireless networks become more commonplace, we can expect that spam will find its way into upcoming wireless communication services. This paper studies the threat posed by malicious nodes inserting spam in a wireless network using gossiping as a method for information dissemination. We identify the security mechanisms needed to protect our gossip network against the proliferation of spam, reducing the problem to a matter of finding and removing corrupted messages. Finally, we propose a probabilistic method of integrity checking to contain the spread of spam which we evaluate through extensive simulations},

With the significant attention currently placed on wireless mesh networking, deployment of these mesh networks may be imminent. However, even with the infrastructure in place, development of flexible middleware has yet to reach a level where it can deliver on the promise of mesh networks due to the special characteristics of wireless connectivity. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized news service based on epidemics. Its simple design makes for a scalable and robust solution, flexible enough to be used as the basis for other more sophisticated applications.},

	Abstract = {
The [`]fast and frugal' approach to reasoning (Gigerenzer, G., & Todd, P. M. (1999). Simple heuristics that make us smart. New York: Oxford University Press) claims that individuals use non-compensatory strategies in judgment - the idea that only one cue is taken into account in reasoning. The simplest and most important of these heuristics postulates that judgment sometimes relies solely on recognition. However, the studies that have investigated usage of the recognition heuristic have confounded recognition with other cues that could also lead to similar judgments. This paper tests whether mere recognition is actually driving the findings in support of the recognition heuristic. Two studies provide evidence that judgments do not conform to the recognition heuristic when these confounds are accounted for. Implications for the study of simple heuristics are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This study introduces a novel framework for evaluating passage and XML retrieval. The framework focuses on a user's effort to localize relevant content in a result document. Measuring the effort is based on a system guided reading order of documents. The effort is calculated as the quantity of text the user is expected to browse through. More specifically, this study seeks evaluation metrics for retrieval methods following a specific fetch and browse approach, where in the fetch phase documents are ranked in decreasing order according to their document score, like in document retrieval. In the browse phase, for each retrieved document, a set of non-overlapping passages representing the relevant text within the document is retrieved. In other words, the passages of the document are re-organized, so that the best matching passages are read first in sequential order. We introduce an application scenario motivating the framework, and propose sample metrics based on the framework. These metrics give a basis for the comparison of effectiveness between traditional document retrieval and passage/XML retrieval and illuminate the benefit of passage/XML retrieval.},

	Abstract = {Sensor networks with a number of wirelessly inter-connected devices have proven useful for many applications in diverse domains. The challenges of scale and resource constraints posed by this system have led to development of novel network protocols and services, but their focus has been on traditional metrics of quality of service of network data transport. Arguing that a holistic view of these systems requires an end-to-end view that combines networking quality of service concerns with the data quality and integrity of sensor sources and performance of sensor fusion algorithms, we propose to use the ldquoquality of informationrdquo (QoI) as a performance metric associated with the end result produced by a sensor network. In this paper we describe the factors that affect QoI, and describe how network protocols and services can be designed to be QoI aware.},

	Abstract = {{Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others {\^a}€'' a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.}},

	Abstract = {{Scholars, advertisers and political activists see massive online social
networks as a representation of social interactions that can be used to study
the propagation of ideas, social bond dynamics and viral marketing, among
others. But the linked structures of social networks do not reveal actual
interactions among people. Scarcity of attention and the daily rythms of life
and work makes people default to interacting with those few that matter and
that reciprocate their attention. A study of social interactions within Twitter
reveals that the driver of usage is a sparse and hidden network of connections
underlying the declared set of friends and followers.}},
