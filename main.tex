\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
% Finish this section and tidy up, etc.

%This thesis and the research it contains would not exist if it weren't for the unfailing support of my supervisors, Roger Whitaker and, particularly, Stuart Allen (Dr / Prof?). Their guidance and input have provided drive and shaped my research and have given me confidence in producing and defending ideas both within and outside of research.

%My utmost gratitude is extended to them for this and for their continuing encouragement, right to the end. They were always there, even during the harder times, and provided fresh ideas and clarification for research pathways and for keeping me on track.\\
%I feel confident in saying that I was very lucky in being in their supervision.

%I'd also like to lend my thanks to Dr Martin Chorley for his continuously helpful and enthusiastic crowdsourcing expertise, without which the research could not have been validated in the way it has.

%Dr Matt Williams (yes, I said "Dr") has provided insight throughout my research, from sessions bouncing ideas back and forth, to recommendations on direction. His ideas have helped bring life to many of the notions in this thesis.


\chapter*{Abstract}
Information sharing on the Internet has given rise to the increased presence of non-interesting and `noisy' information in media streams on many online social networks. Although there is, however, a lot of `interesting' information also shared amongst users, the noise increases the cognitive burden in terms of the users' abilities to identify the interesting information and may affect the chance of the user missing important or interesting information. 
Additionally, users on such platforms are generally limited to receiving information only from those that they are directly linked to on the social graph, meaning that users exist within distinct information `bubbles', further limiting the chance of receiving interesting and relevant information from outside of the immediate social circle. 
In this thesis, Twitter is used as a platform for researching methods for deriving information ``interestingness'' through information popularity as given by the mechanism of \textit{retweeting}, which allows information to be propagated further between users on Twitter's social graph. Retweet behaviours are studied, and various properties are uncovered which relate retweet action to the social graph. This culminates in research into a methodology for assigning scores to Tweets based on their `quality', which is validated to perform well in various situations, and is analysed to demonstrate its potential in highlighting interesting information in mixed information streams.
