\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
% Finish this section and tidy up, etc.

This thesis and the research it contains would not exist if it weren't for the unfailing support of my supervisors, Roger Whitaker and, particularly, Stuart Allen (Dr / Prof?). Their guidance and input have provided drive and shaped my research and have given me confidence in producing and defending ideas both within and outside of research.

My utmost gratitude is extended to them for this and for their continuing encouragement, right to the end. They were always there, even during the harder times, and provided fresh ideas and clarification for research pathways and for keeping me on track.\\
I feel confident in saying that I was very lucky in being in their supervision.

I'd also like to lend my thanks to Dr Martin Chorley for his continuously helpful and enthusiastic crowdsourcing expertise, without which the research could not have been validated in the way it has.

Dr Matt Williams (yes, I said "Dr") has provided insight throughout my research, from sessions bouncing ideas back and forth, to recommendations on direction. His ideas have helped bring life to many of the notions in this thesis.
